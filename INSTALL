1.) READ the README.linux file and the accompanying man pages (so it exists ;)).
    It will save you some frustration. Be sure to review syslogd.conf.sample
    it currently is the only place that contains information about the new
    syslogd.conf format!

2.) Edit the Makefile for your installation.  NOTE that if you have not
    carried out step 1 you may make choices which could render your
    system and/or these utilities unusable.  Compile the utilities.
    Compilation has been tested with versions 2.5.8, 2.6.3 and 2.7.0 of
    the gcc compiler and libc versions 4.5.26 and 4.6.27.

3.) The FSSTND makes suggestions as to appropriate locations for
    system binaries.  Since not everyone agrees with standards it is
    up to the system administrator installing the utilities to choose
    the most appropriate locations for the binaries and their
    configuration files.  By default the package will compile and
    install following the FSSTND recommendations.  If a decision is
    made to change this behavior consult the makefile and the sources.
    The FSSTND define controls selection of values which may be
    influenced by the choice of conformance with the FSSTND or site
    preferences.

4.) For proper functioning the daemon is best run as root.
    This is probably not much of a problem since it will probably be
    started either by init or as part of the rc.* startup process.  There
    may be security concerns with running it as root.  Please repeat
    step 1 if you are unsure of why this may be the case.

5.) YOU NEED TO DECIDE IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO REPLACE THE STANDARD SYSLOGD OR NOT!
    The is important as it influences the names used. If you call
    make install
    it will install this program under the name of rsyslogd. If you call it with
    make install-replace
    it will replace the existing syslogd, but save the former one under the name
    of syslogd-previous. If you run install-replace multiple times, your
    syslogd-previous will be OVERWRITTEN!
    In either case, the system startup files will not be touched. If you use
    install-replace, everthing should work as always, but if it doesn't, you've
    probably discovered a beta bug ;) In any case, to use the new features, you 
    need to update you syslogd.conf.
