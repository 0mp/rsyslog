<h1>rsyslog packages</h1>
<p><b>Thanks to some volunteers, rsyslog is also available in package form on 
some distributions.</b> All available packages are listed below. If you would 
like to maintain a package for a new distribution, please mail me at
<a href="mailto:rgerhards@adiscon.com">rgerhards@adiscon.com</a>. Any help is *deeply* 
appreciated. While I create the core daemon, the package maintainers are really 
filling it with life, making it available to the average user. I am very 
grateful for that!</p>
<p>This list has last been updated on 2006-09-26 by

New packages may appear at any time, so be sure to check this page whenever you 
need a new one.</p>
<h2>CentOS 4.3</h2>

<p>Maintained by<b> James Bergamin.</b></p>
<h2>Almost any Linux</h2>
<p><b>Bennet Todd</b> maintains packages that should work on almost any Linux. 
He keeps a current i386 tree. There is also a PPC tree, but that one is not paid 
much attention for (anyhow, it is known to typically work well, too).</p>
<p>Please visit <a href="http://bent.latency.net/bent/">
http://bent.latency.net/bent/</a>, select the relevant tree and then do a search 
for rsyslog.</p>
