<h1>Fix invalid UTF-8 Sequences (mmutf8fix)</h1>
<p><b>Module Name:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mmutf8fix</b></p>
<p><b>Author: </b>Rainer Gerhards &lt;rgerhards@adiscon.com&gt;</p>
<p><b>Available since</b>: 7.5.4</p>
<p><b>Description</b>:</p>
<p>The mmutf8fix module permits to fix invalid UTF-8 sequences.
Most often, such invalid sequences result from syslog sources sending
in non-UTF character sets, e.g. ISO 8859. As syslog does not have a way
to convey the character set information, these sequences are not properly
handled. While they are typically uncritical with plain text files, they can
cause big headache with database sources as well as systems like ElasticSearch.
<p>The module is an experiement at "fixing" such encoding problems. It
begun as a very simple replacer of non-control characters, and actually breaks
some UTF-8 encoding right now. If the module turns out to be useful, it
should be enhanced to support modes that really detect invalid UTF8. In the longer term
it could also be evolved into an any-charset-to-UTF8 converter. But
first let's see if it really gets into widespread enough use.
<p>What it currently does is simply replace all US-ASCII control characters
(characters ouside the range of 32 to 126) by a configured replacement
character. For forward compatibility, this will remain the default mode
in the future. However, as said above, more useful modes will be added
based on user feedback and demand.

<p><b>Proper Usage</b>:</p>
<p>Some notes are due for proper use of this module. This is a message modification
module utilizing the action interface, which means you call it like an action.
This gives great flexibility on the question on when and how to call this module.
Note that once it has been called, it actually modifies the message. The original
messsage is then no longer available. However, this does <b>not</b> change any
properties set, used or extracted before the modification is done.
<p>One potential use case is to normalize all messages. This is done by simply calling
mmutf8fix right in front of all other actions.
<p>If only a specific source (or set of sources) is known to cause problems,
mmutf8fix can be conditionally called only on messages from them. This also offers
performance benefits. If such multiple sources exists, it probably is a good idea
to define different listeners for their incoming traffic, bind them to specific
<a href="multi_ruleset.html">ruleset</a> and call mmutf8fix as first action in this
ruleset.

<p><b>Module Configuration Parameters</b>:</p>
<p>Currently none.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Action Confguration Parameters</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>replacementChar</b> - default " " (space), a single character<br>
This is the character that invalid sequences are replaced by.
</ul>

<p><b>Caveats/Known Bugs:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>only IPv4</b> is supported
</ul>

<p><b>Samples:</b></p>
<p>In this snippet, we write one file without fixing UTF-8 and another one
with the message fixed. Note that once mmutf8fix has run, access to the 
original message is no longer possible.
<p><textarea rows="5" cols="60">module(load="mmutf8fix")
action(type="omfile" file="/path/to/non-fixed.log")
action(type="mmutf8fix")
action(type="omfile" file="/path/to/fixed.log")
</textarea>

<p>In this sample, we fix only message originating from host 10.0.0.1.
<p><textarea rows="5" cols="60">module(load="mmutf8fix")
if $fromhost-ip == "10.0.0.1" then
    action(type="mmutf8fix")
# all other actions here...
</textarea>
