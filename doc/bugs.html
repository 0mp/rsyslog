<h1>rsyslog bugs and annoyances</h1>
<p><b>This page lists the known bugs rsyslog has to offer.</b> Please note that 
we also have a
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=696552&group_id=123448&func=browse">
bug tracker at sourceforge.net</a>. This list here contains more architectural 
things while the bug tracker most often lists things that you will actually 
experience. Please be sure to visit the bug tracker in addition to this list 
here.</p>
<p>This list has last been updated on 2007-06-28 by

<h1>rsyslogd</h1>
<h2>IPv6</h2>
<p>IPv6 is currently supported for UDP, only. TCP support is to follow.</p>
<h2>AllowedSender and IPv6</h2>
<p>AllowedSenders currently can be used with IPv4, only. IPv6 senders are always 
allowed. If you need access control for IPv6, use iptables. AllowedSender 
support for IPv6 will most probably be added. Please note that you can also 
disable IPv6 support by specifying -4 on the command line.</p>
<h2>REPEATED LOG LINES</h2>
<p>If multiple log lines with the exact same content are received,
   the duplicates are NOT suppressed. This is done by sysklogd
   in all cases. We plan to add this as an optional feature,
   but as of now every line is logged.</p>
<h2>EQUALLY-NAMED TEMPLATES</h2>
<p>If multiple templates with the SAME name are created, all but the
   first definition is IGNORED. So you can NOT (yet) replace a
   template definition. I also strongly doubt I will ever support this, because 
it does not make an awful lot of sense (after all, why not use two template 
names...).</p>
<h2>MEMORY LEAK ON HUPING</h2>
<p>Currently, the template memory is NOT freed when SIGHUP is received.
   This causes a small memory leak on each HUP. Will be fixed soon and
   should not cause real trouble unless you HUP syslogd quite frequently.</p>
<h2>WALLMSG FORMAT (* selector)
   </h2>
<p>This format is actually not 100% compatible with stock syslogd - the
   date is missing. Will be fixed soon and can also be fixed just via
   the proper template. Anyone up for this? ;)</p>
<h2>SIGPIPE HANDLING</h2>
<p>Currently, SIGPIPE is ignored. This is necessary to handle broken TCP
  connections. We should further look into this issue and see which other
  ways exist to handle the situation.</p>
<h2>MULTIPLE INSTANCES</h2>
<p>If multiple instances are running on a single machine, the one with
  the -r switch must start first. Also, UDP-based syslog forwarding between the 
instances does not work. Use TCP instead.</p>
