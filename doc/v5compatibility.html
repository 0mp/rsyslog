<h1>Compatibility Notes for rsyslog v5</h1>
<p><small><i>Written by <a href="http://www.gerhards.net/rainer">Rainer Gerhards</a>

<p>The changes introduced in rsyslog v5 are numerous, but not very intrusive.
This document describes things to keep in mind when moving from v4 to v5. It 
does not list enhancements nor does it talk about compatibility concerns introduced
by earlier versions (for this, see their respective compatibility documents).
<h2>HUP processing</h2>
<p>The $HUPisRestart directive is supported by some early v5 versions, but has been removed
in 5.1.3 and above.  That means that restart-type HUP processing is no longer
available. This processing was redundant and had a lot a drawbacks. 
For details, please see the
<a href="v4compatibility.html">rsyslog v4 compatibility notes</a> which elaborate
on the reasons and the (few) things you may need to change.
