<h1>Debug Support</h1>
<p>
Rsyslog provides a number of debug aids. Some of them are activated by
adding the --enable-rtinst ./configure option ("rtinst" means runtime
instrumentation). Turning debugging on obviously costs some performance
(in some cases considerable).
</p>
<p>This is document is just being created and thus terse.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Signals supported</p>
<p>SIGUSR1 - turns debug messages on and off (expect this signal
to go away over time)</p>
<p>SIGUSR2 - outputs debug information (including active threads
and a call stack) for the state when SIGUSR2 was received. This is a
one-time output. Can be sent as often as the user likes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Environment Variables</p>
<p>Environment variables set several debug settings. This is
intended to become the primary way to configure debugging support.
Currently are defined:</p>
<ul>
<li>RSYSLOG_DEBUGLOG="/path/to/debuglog/" - writes (allmost)
all debug message to the specified log file in addition to stdout. Some
system messages (e.g. segfault or abort message) are not written to the
file as we can not capture them.</li>
</ul>
