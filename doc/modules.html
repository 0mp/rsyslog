<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In theory, modules provide input and output, among other functions, in 
rsyslog. In practice, modules are only utilized for output in the current 
release. The module interface is not yet completed and a moving target. We do 
not recommend to write a module based on the current specification. If you do, 
please be prepared that future released of rsyslog will probably break your 
module. </p>
<p>A goal of modularization is to provide an easy to use plug-in interface. 
However, this goal is not yet reached and all modules must be statically linked.</p>
<h2>Module Security</h2>
<p>Modules are directly loaded into rsyslog's address space. As such, any module 
is provided a big level of trust. Please note that further module interfaces 
might provide a way to load a module into an isolated address space. This, 
however, is far from being completed. So the number one rule about module 
security is to run only code that you know you can trust.</p>
