<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p><i><b>In this paper, I describe how log massive amounts of
<a href="http://www.monitorware.com/en/topics/syslog/">syslog</a>

messages to a database. </b>This HOWTO is currently under development and thus a 
bit brief. Updates are promised ;).</i></p>

<h2>The Intention</h2>

<p>Database updates are inherently slow when it comes to storing syslog 
messages. However, there are a number of applications where it is handy to have 
the message inside a database. Rsyslog supports native database writing via 
output plugins. As of this writing, there are plugins available for MySQL an 
PostgreSQL. Maybe additional plugins have become available by the time you read 
this. Be sure to check.</p>
<p>In order to successfully write messages to a database backend, the backend 
must be capable to record messages at the expected average arrival rate. This is 
the rate if you take all messages that can arrive within a day and divide it by 
86400 (the number of seconds per day). Let's say you expect 43,200,000 messages 
per day. That's an average rate of 500 messages per second (mps). Your database 
server MUST be able to handle that amount of message per second on a sustained 
rate. If it doesn't, you either need to add an additional server, lower the 
number of message - or forget about it.</p>
<p>However, this is probably not your peak rate. Let's simply assume your 
systems work only half a day, that's 12 hours (and, yes, I know this is 
unrealistic, but you'll get the point soon). So your average rate is actually 
1,000 mps during work hours and 0 mps during non-work hours. To make matters 
worse, workload is not divided evenly during the day. So you may have peaks of 
up to 10,000mps while at other times the load may go down to maybe just 100mps. 
Peaks may stay well above 2,000mps for a few minutes.</p>
<p>So how the hack you will be able to handle all of this traffic (including the 
peaks) with a database server that is just capable of inserting a maximum of 
500mps?</p>
<p>The key here is buffering. Messages that the database server is not capable 
to handle will be buffered until it is. Of course, that means database insert 
are NOT real-time. If you need real-time inserts, you need to make sure your 
database server can handle traffic at the actual peak rate. But lets assume you 
are OK with some delay.</p>
<p>Buffering is fine. But how about these massive amounts of data? That can't be 
hold in memory, so don't we run out of luck with buffering? The key here is that 
rsyslog can not only buffer in memory but also buffer to disk (this may remind 
you of &quot;spooling&quot; which gets you the right idea). There are several queuing 
modes available, offering differnent throughput. In general, the idea is to 
buffer in memory until the memory buffer is exhausted and switch to 
disk-buffering when needed (and only as long as needed). All of this is handled 
automatically and transparently by rsyslog.</p>
<p>With our above scenario, the disk buffer would build up during the day and 
rsyslog would use the night to drain it. Obviously, this is an extreme example, 
but it shows what can be done. Please note that queue content survies rsyslogd 
restarts, so even a reboot of the system will not cause any message loss.</p>
<h2>How To Setup</h2>
<p>Frankly, it's quite easy. You just need to do is instruct rsyslog to use a 
disk queue and then configure your action. There is nothing else to do. With the 
following simple config file, you log anything you receive to a MySQL database 
and have buffering applied automatically.</p>
<textarea rows="11" cols="80">$ModLoad ommysql.so # load the output driver (use ompgsql.so for PostgreSQL)
$ModLoad imudp.so # network reception
$ModLoad imuxsock.so # local message reception

$WorkDirectory /rsyslog/work # default location for work (spool) files
$MainMsgQueueFileName mainq  # set file name, also enables disk mode

*.*       :ommysql:hostname,dbname,userid,password;
</textarea>
<p>Note that you can modify a lot of queue performance parameters, but the above
config will get you going with default values. If you consider using this on a real
busy server, it is strongly recommended to invest some time in setting the tuning
parameters to appropriate values.</p>
