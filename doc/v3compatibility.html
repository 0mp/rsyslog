<h1>Compatibility notes for rsyslog v3</h1>
		<P><small><i>Written by

<P>Rsyslog aims to be a drop-in replacement for sysklogd. However, version 3 has 
some considerable enhancements, which lead to some backward compatibility issues 
both in regard to sysklogd and rsyslog v1 and v2.</P>
<P>Rsyslog v3 is currently under initial development. Compatibility issues may 
be resolved, so be sure to check back often. Also, comments and suggestions are 
appreciated. Feedback right in time can now have a big impact on the route we 
take ;)</P>
<h2>-m command line option</h2>
<P>The -m command line option is ignored for the time being. There is no default 
mark period. If you need a 20 minute mark period you need to</P>
<P><b>$ModLoad immark # wherever this is<br>
$MarkMessageInterval 1800 # 20 minutes</b></P>
<h2>klogd</h2>
<P>klogd has (finally) been replaced by a loadable input module. To enable klogd 
functionality, do</P>
<P><b>$ModLoad imklog</b></P>
<P>A limited set of klogd command line settings is now supported via 
rsyslog.conf. That set of configuration directives is to be expanded. So far, we 
support:</P>
<P>$klogSymbolsTwice [on/off]<br>
$DebugPrintKernelSymbols [on/off] # spits *a lot* of messages at startup</P>
