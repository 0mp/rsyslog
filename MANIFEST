This file basically stems back to the sysklog package. It is currently not
being maintained and is considered to be replaced by some other method
in the future. We have not yet removed it, because it still contains some
helpful information. When using it, keep in mind that it is not up to date.
However, what is written here still applies, but often is not the
sole truth ;)

A virgin copy of these sources should include 12 files:

MANIFEST:	This file.

INSTALL:	Brief installation instructions.

NEWS:		Important changes.

Makefile:	A makefile to generate the binaries.

README.linux:	Documentation which may prove useful.

syslogd.c:	Source code for the system log daemon.

pidfile.c:	Source implementing utility functions which are useful
		for managing pid files.  Used by both syslogd and klogd.

pidfile.h:	Include file containing global definitions for the
		pid file utility functions.

version.h:	An include file for setting the version and patchlevel
		for the package.

sample.conf:	A sample configuration file.  Note that this file uses
		extensions to the BSD syntax.  See the syslog.conf(5)
		manpage for more details.

####new####
syslog.c:	A slightly modified version of the syslog.c file found in
		the standard libraries.  This special version is needed
		so that klogd will pass messages with kernel priority to
		the syslogd facility.
