This directory contains the rsyslog testbench. It is slowly
evolving. New tests are always welcome. So far, most tests check
out the functionality of a single module. More complex tests are
welcome.

For a simple sample, see rtinit.c, which does a simple
init/deinit check of the runtime system.

Setting up MariaDB/MySQL
to create the necessary user:

echo "create user 'rsyslog'@'localhost' identified by 'testbench';" | mysql -u root
mysql -u root < ../plugins/ommysql/createDB.sql
echo "grant all on Syslog.* to 'rsyslog'@'localhost';" | mysql -u root
