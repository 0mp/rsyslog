---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.8.4

- improved -d debug output (removed developer-only content)
- now compiles under FreeBSD
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.8.3

- security model in "make install" changed
- minor doc updates
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.8.2

- added man page for rsyslog.conf and rsyslogd
- gave up on the concept of rsyslog being a "drop in" replacement
  for syslogd. Now, the user installs rsyslogd and also needs to
  adjust his system settings to this specifically. This also lead
  to these changes:
  * changed Makefile so that install now installs rsyslogd instead
    of dealing with syslogd
  * changed the default config file name to rsyslog.conf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.8.1

- fixed a nasty memory leak (probably not the last one with this release)
- some enhancements to Makefile as suggested by Bennett Todd
- syslogd-internal messages (like restart) were missing the hostname
  this has been corrected
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.8.0

Initial testing release. Based on the sysklogd package. Thanks to the
sysklogd maintainers for all their good work!
